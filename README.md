#About This Repository

This repository contains projects and exercises that I have completed as I develop my skills as a data analyst. As a beginner in this field, I am committed to learning new techniques and tools, and I will be updating this repository with new projects as I progress.

#Projects

Each project in this repository includes a README file with a brief description of the project, the data sources used, and a summary of my findings. I have included my code in Jupyter Notebooks, which will allow you to replicate my analyses and explore the data further.

#Tools and Techniques

In my projects, I use a variety of tools and techniques, including Python, SQL, MongoDB and Tableu. I am also work with data visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, pandas, sklearn. As I develop my skills, I may add additional tools and techniques to my repertoire.

#Feedback

I welcome feedback on my projects and code, as I am always looking for ways to improve. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any suggestions or improvements.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my repository, and I hope you find my projects useful and informative.
