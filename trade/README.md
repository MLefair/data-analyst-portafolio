This is a competition project from de DataCamp competitions.

This project goal is to build a portafolio strategy of inversion in Bitcoin, S&P 500 and Gold.

For this goal we perform the next tasks:
1. How does the performance of Bitcoin compare to the S&P 500 and the price of gold?
2. Analyze Bitcoin's returns and volatility profile. Do you believe it could help improve the performance of a portfolio? Do you believe Bitcoin could be used as a hedge versus inflation?
3. We are looking for lower volatility in the fund. Explore building a portfolio using some or all of these assets. Make a recommendation that minimizes overall risk.
